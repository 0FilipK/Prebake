        <h1>Prebake</h1>

<p>A set of Adblock filters to block obtrusive EU cookie law notices.</p>

<p><a>Subscribe to the obtrusive notice filter.</a></p>

<p><a>Additionally, subscribe to the quiet notice filter.</a></p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The <em>Obtrusive</em> list blocks cookie notices that either consume a
considerable amount of screen real estate or popup and distract the
viewers attention.</p>

<p>The <em>Quiet</em> list blocks all other notices regardless of their size
or obnoxiousness. Using this list isn't recommended but is provided
for completeness. Simple two- or three-word links to privacy pages
aren't blocked (such as links in a page footer), but a lengthy
paragraph mid-page will be.</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>There are going to be sites that I have missed, or I may have just
screwed up with a CSS selector. In any case, feel free to point out
bugs or request new sites to be added via the <a href="https://github.com/liamja/Prebake/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>,
or submit a pull request.</p>

<h2>User Agreement</h2>

<p>By using these filters, you are accepting and allowing sites to
set cookies by default. You agree to allow the sites you visit to
set cookies.</p>

<p>Only use these filters if you understand the implications of
allowing cookies.</p>
